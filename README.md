Google-Play-Music-Album-Sorter
==============================

Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey UserScript for extending Google Play Music with album sorting functionality


Prerequisites
-------------

To be able to employ the UserScript, your browser needs to have corresponding extensions installed:

 - Chrome: [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
 - Firefox: [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)


Installation
------------

Once your browser is equipped with appropriate extension, simply open [this link](https://github.com/VipSaran/Google-Play-Music-Album-Sorter/raw/master/google_play_music_album_sorter.user.js). The extension should recognize the script and offer you to install it.


Limitations

 - works only on standalone "Albums" view
 - sorts only by album year


To-Do
-----------

 - after sorting by year, also sort by name (in same order)
 - switch between year and name sorting

Changelog
---------

1.0.1

 - adapted to content div id change
